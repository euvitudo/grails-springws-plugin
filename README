This project is a clone of Russ Miles' codehaus svn repo:

	http://svn.codehaus.org/grails-plugins/grails-springws/trunk
	http://svn.codehaus.org/grails-plugins

It has been updated to spring-security-3.1.0.RELEASE, but still needs plenty of work.

For example, currently it references acegi.

The plugin may or may not work.  It will be tested soon.
